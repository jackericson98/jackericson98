# Jack Ericson

## About Me
I am a computational physicist/chemist with expertise in data science, numerical analysis and scientific simulations. I currently work at Georgia State University, where I recieved my Master's in Chemistry and specialize in developing software that solves complex problems in molecular analysis and gometric decompositions. I am passionate about using my skills in scince and technology to develop solutions to promote a more sustainable future.

## Projects
### Vorpy 
A comprehensive Voronoi cell network generator for 3D spheres designed for simulated molecular dynamics (md) analysis. This software creates it's partitionings using a sampling of points from a Voronoi S-Network providing more detailed measurements of volumes and surface areas of relevant atomic groupings (residues, chains, sheets, etc.) In combination with molecular simulation software, the evolution of these measurements can provide insight into key biological processes.

### GUTCP - A classical approach to the standard model
The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics, developed by Dr. Randall Mills, experiments with the idea of using electromagnetism to unify quantum mechanics with classical physics. These phenomena are simulated using python, starting with the Young's double slit experiment and Stern-Gerlach with the "classical electron".

## Research
### University of Georgia
2018 - Physics Department<br\>
Working in an optics lab we measured the Faraday rotation of polarized light in various dielectric materials under a strong magnetic field. Controlling the rotation of polarized light has applications in ranging technologies from visual display to fiber optics. 

### Georgia State University
2021-Present - Chemistry Department<br\>

#### Software Development for Geometric Analasys of 

#### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis
The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data is used to analyze biological processes as they occur. By perturbing the nuclei of atoms (similar to MRI) and recording the frequency of the radiation that is returned atomic movements can be tracked at the nanosecond scale. 

#### Molecular Dynamics 
Molecular dynamics (MD) uses physically realistic physics packages to leapfrog atomic movements and predict biological and other atomic scale interactions. These interactions tend to be stochastic and provide large amounts of data. With the use of principal component and time series analysis physically significant phenomena can be extracted and measured.
