## About Me
I am a computational physicist with expertise in data science, numerical analysis and scientific simulations. I currently work at Georgia State University and specialize in developing software that solves complex problems in molecular analysis. I am passionate about using my skills in scince and technology to develop energy solutions to promote a more sustainable future. My career objective is to pursue a PhD in high energy Nuclear Physics to work towards developing the new generation of fusion powerplants that will power the future. 

## Projects
### Vorpy 
A comprehensive Voronoi cell network generator for 3D spheres designed for simulated molecular dynamics (md) analysis. This software creates it's partitionings using a sampling of points from a Voronoi S-Network providing more detailed measurements of volumes and surface areas of relevant atomic groupings (residues, chains, sheets, etc.) In combination with molecular simulation software, the evolution of these measurements can provide insight into key biological processes.

### GUTCP - A classical approach to the standard model
The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics, developed by Dr. Randall Mills, experiments with the idea of using electromagnetism to unify quantum mechanics with classical physics. These phenomena are simulated using python, starting with the Young's double slit experiment and Stern-Gerlach with the "classical electron".

 ### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis
The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data is used to analyze biological processes as they occur. By perturbing the nuclei of atoms (similar to MRI) and recording the frequency of the radiation that is returned atomic movements can be tracked at the nanosecond scale. 

### Molecular Dynamics 
Molecular dynamics (MD) uses physicallys realistic physics packages to leapfrog atomic movements and predict biological and other atomic scale interactions. These interactions tends to be stochastic and provide large amounts of data. With the use of principal component and time series analysis physically significant phenomena are able to be extracted and measured.

## Research
#### University of Georgia
2018 - Physics Department - Dr.Zhao
Working in an optics lab we measured the Faraday rotation of polarized light in various dielectric materials under a strong magnetic field. Controlling the rotation of polarized light has applicatopns in ranging technologies from visual display to fiber optics. 

#### Georgia State University
With the chemistry department at Georgia State University I was able to research methods of analyzing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data and develop models of fitting relaxation data. The development  development of several chemical analysis models written in python. These models have been used to demonstrate phenomenon in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data as well as X-Ray Crystyllographic data. T
