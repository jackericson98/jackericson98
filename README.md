### Vorpy 
A molecular analysis tool for the study of simulated inter atomic partitionings. With traditional partitionings, power diagrams or Delaunay networks are constructed. This software creates it's partitionings using a sampling of points from a Voronoi S-Network. This provides more detailed measurements of volumes and surface areas of relevant atominc groupings (residues, chains, sheets, etc.) In combination with molecular simulation software, the evolution of these measurements can provide insight into key biological processes.

### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis
The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data is used to analyze biological processes as they occur. By perturbing the electrons and analyzing the signals, movements can be tracked from nanosecond interactions. This NMR data tends to be stochastic and seemingly random, but with the use of principal component analysis and time series analysis certain phenomena were able to be extracted.


### GUTCP - A classical approach to the standard model
The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics, develiped by Dr. Randall Mills, experiments with the idea of using electromagnetism to unify quantum mechanics with classical physics. These phenomena are simulated using python, starting with the double slit experiment and Starn-Gerlach with the "classical electron". 

## Education
### University of Georgia
January 2017 - August 2019
I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Physics with an emphasis in Electrodynamics and Computational Optics. I was able to graduate a year early while still taking adiditonal coursework in Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science 

### Georgia State University
August 2019 - Present
I have been taking adiditonal coursework to work towards a degree in Data Science and have been employed by the Chemistry Department developing analysis software since 2021.  

### Research
#### University of Georgia
2018 - Physics Department - Dr.Zhao
My research centered around the study of the Faraday rotation of polarized light in certain dielectric materials under the influence of a strong magnetic field. Using a 90A electro magnet and several optical measuring devices, a polarized light beam would be directed through a dielctric and the angle of polarization would vary depending on the magnetic field applied to that dielectric matereal and the dielectric material itself. 

#### Georgia State University
My research at Georgias State consists of the development of several chemical analysis models written in python. These models have been used to demonstrate phenomenon in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data as well as X-Ray Crystyllographic data. The data from NMR modles were analyzed using time series analysis and principal component analysis techniques. 

The other aspect of my research is the developemnt of a simulated molecular partitioning and analysis tool (see vorpy). This is the first ever Voronois S-network atomic partitioning tool. The Voronoi S-network Partitioning provides the most precise inter-atomic surface area and volume measurments. For Example: The volume of a molecule in solution could be determined by the summation of the volumes of all of the molecule's atomic partitionings.
