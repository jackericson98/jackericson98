## VorPy - A molecular partitioning tool
[Vorpy](https://github.com/jackericson98/vorpy) is a spatial partitioning tool designed to solve, analyze, and export Additively Weighted, Power (Leguerre), and/or Primitive (Delaunay) Voronoi diagrams for systems of 3D spheres. This tool can accept atomic coordinate files of all major file extensions (or txt files in the right format), solve their Voronoi graphs and output visualizations and analysis of their geometry. With both a grapical user interface for simple cases and a command line interface for more complicated or cases VorPy has a robust input/output abilities.

[Coarsify](https://github.com/jackericson98/coarsify) is a Python tool for coarse-graining molecular structures from various file formats (.pdb, .gro, .mol, .cif, .xyz) into simplified representations using different coarse-graining schemes. Designed for researchers working with molecular dynamics simulations who need to approximate molecules as fewer spheres or perform structural analysis.


## Foamify - A Random foam generating tool

[Foamify](https://github.com/jackericson98/foamify) (formerly foam_gen) is an interactive, randomized foam generator designed for scientific modeling and visualization. Foamify creates coordinate files specifying the locations and radii of a randomly generated ensemble of spheres, allowing users to produce custom foams for a wide range of applications. These virtual foams can be used to simulate and analyze physics-based systems such as aerated media, porous materials, and other complex microstructures. Sphere generation is governed by a flexible set of user-defined parameters, offering full control over the statistical and geometric characteristics of the output.

## GUTCP - A classical approach to the standard model
The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics, developed by Dr. Randall Mills, experiments with the idea of using electromagnetism to unify quantum mechanics with classical physics. These phenomena are simulated using python, starting with the Young's double slit experiment and Stern-Gerlach with the "classical electron".

## Research
### University of Georgia
2018 - Physics Department<br\>
Working in an optics lab we measured the Faraday rotation of polarized light in various dielectric materials under a strong magnetic field. Controlling the rotation of polarized light has applications in ranging technologies from visual display to fiber optics. 

### Georgia State University
2021-Present - Chemistry Department<br\>

#### Software Development for Geometric Analasys of 

#### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis
The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data is used to analyze biological processes as they occur. By perturbing the nuclei of atoms (similar to MRI) and recording the frequency of the radiation that is returned atomic movements can be tracked at the nanosecond scale. 

#### Molecular Dynamics 
Molecular dynamics (MD) uses physically realistic physics packages to leapfrog atomic movements and predict biological and other atomic scale interactions. These interactions tend to be stochastic and provide large amounts of data. With the use of principal component and time series analysis physically significant phenomena can be extracted and measured.
